This repository aggregates configurations, scripts and tips for using [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) as an image viewer. The affectionate nickname `mvi` is given to mpv in such case.

This README assumes basic familiarity with mpv and its configuration. The information here should be platform-agnostic for the most part.

# Why?

mpv is a competent video player and sufficiently lightweight to use comfortably to view images. It features advanced scaling algorithms and color management, which are key features in an image viewer.  
It is also very extensible which allows us to compensate for some missing image viewer features easily.  
It won't compete with `feh` or the likes when it comes to size or startup time, but it is still plenty fast.

# Configuration

There are several options for making an mvi configuration.  
* You can create an entirely separate `~/.config/mvi/` directory and use the alias `alias mvi='mpv --config-dir=$HOME/.config/mvi'` 
* Or keep a separate profile in your mpv config and alias it like that `alias mvi=mpv --profile=image'`. 

The first option can be cleaner, at the cost of some duplication.

The examples `mpv.conf` and `input.conf` in this repository are commented to highlight (un)desirable settings.

# Scripts

## image-viewer.lua

The `scripts/image-viewer.lua` script offers several commands that are common in image viewers:

`drag-to-pan`: pan the image with the cursor, while keeping the same part of the image under the cursor  
`pan-follows-cursor`: pan the image in the direction of the cursor  
`cursor-centric-zoom`: (de)zoom the video while keeping the same part of the image under the cursor  
`align-border`: align the border of the image with the border of the window  
`pan-image`: pan the image in a direction, optionally ignoring the zoom or forcing the image to stay visible  
`rotate-video`: rotate the image in 90 degrees increment  
`reset-pan-if-visible`: reset the pan if the entire image is visible  
`force-print-filename`: print the filename, even if console output is disabled  
`enable-status-line`, `disable-status-line`, `toggle-status-line`: show a simple status line  
`enable-minimap`, `disable-minimap`, `toggle-minimap`: show a "minimap" that displays the position of the image relatively to the view  
`ruler`: spawn a ruler that lets you visualize various image measurement  

They don't have any default bindings, see the example `input.conf`, and in the configuration bind them.
Some of these commands, the status line and the ruler can be configured via `script-opts/image_viewer.conf`.


## gallery.lua

The [gallery-view](https://github.com/occivink/mpv-gallery-view) plugin helps when navigating large image playlists.

## Others

Some other mpv scripts work well with mvi, here are a few (feel free to send a PR for others):

[zones](https://github.com/wiiaboo/mpv-scripts/blob/master/zones.lua): send different commands depending on cursor position  
[delete-file](https://github.com/zenyd/mpv-scripts#delete-file): delete the current file  
[mpv_crop_script](https://github.com/TheAMM/mpv_crop_script): featureful screenshot tool  
[auto-profiles](https://github.com/wm4/mpv-scripts/blob/master/auto-profiles.lua): apply profiles conditionally. Can be used to lower settings with huge images  
[crop](https://github.com/occivink/mpv-scripts#croplua): simple cropping script  
[autoload](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/TOOLS/lua/autoload.lua): automatically load all files in the same directory  
[playlist-manager](https://github.com/jonniek/mpv-playlistmanager): playlist management script  
[mpv-stats](https://github.com/Argon-/mpv-stats): show some info about the input file (integrated into mpv in 0.28+)  

# Tips

## Piping mpv to other applications

It is possible to use mpv in shell to act as a visual filter for input files.  

Simply load the "silent" profile, and call `force-print-filname` to print the name of the current file for the next program in the pipe. You should take care of using "newline" as file separator.  

For example, if one wanted to delete images they could run something like this:
```
IFS='
'
mpv --profile=silent images/* | xargs rm
```
and press `p` on each image they want to delete.
